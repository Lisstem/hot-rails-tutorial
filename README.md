# Turbo Rails Tutorial

Source code from doing the [Turbo Rails Tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails).

## Known error
Sadly some things of the tutorial are outdated and don't work anymore.
Luckily there aren't many of them and i hope they get fixed in the future, as I liked the tutorial a lot.

So here ist the List:
- the devise gem now supports Turbo by default
- when disabling turbo for the whole app you also need to add `data-turbo="false"` on the html body to disable turbo inside the turbo-frames.
